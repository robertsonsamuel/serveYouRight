### The idea:
Serve You Right is combination web and mobile application built with ionic, that enables waiter and waitresses to provide better and faster service
using devices that they already own. Using Serve You Right, servers only need to return to the kitchen once the order is complete!
They know this as the kitchen has a kitchen view and can complete an order, the waiter or waitress will then receive a text 
message letting them know the order is finished! Happy customers and more productive staff!
